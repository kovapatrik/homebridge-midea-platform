# Downloading lua script for devices

If you need support for a device, or a new feature for an existing one, please do the following:
1. Open the Homebridge Config UI X
2. Do the discovery process through the UI
   - Here you must either use your own Midea SmartHome or Meiju account, or the default Smarthome one (if you don't have your own account in these apps)
3. After the discovery ends, there will be table of discovered devices
4. In the `Model` column, the model of your device will be a button, which you can click to download the lua script for the device.
5. After downloading the script, open an issue about the feature you need and attach the lua script to it (or open an issue and send me the script in email, it's `kovapatrik@gmail.com`)
